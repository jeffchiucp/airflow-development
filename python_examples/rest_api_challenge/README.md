Project instructions:

> Pick a personal 3rd party app; (Gmail, Twitter, CashApp, etc.) 
> Extract REST API JSON data into a staging area for raw data
> Load transformed data (simple filters are ok) into your local postgres database

Transformation is not important here, but rather putting together connections across different software, with airflow.
